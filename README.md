# Solution Bank

A repository for problem attempts by MAPS (Monash Algorithms 'n' Problem Solving)

## Rules

* Don't read the solution to a problem until you've attempted it!
* Give correct author information in the comment of your code
* Follow the directory structure

## Getting started

Run the following to enable some helpful commands:

    source .bashrc

From here, you can:

    cd CodeForces/1783    # Change into the directory for a particular competition
    makedirs F            # Make problem directories for A-F.
    makefile jackson.py   # Make a file based on the template script
    # Edit the file and write your solution...
    # Copy paste the tests into tests/1.in, tests/1.out, ...
    run                   # Run jackson.py against all tests in the `tests` directory
